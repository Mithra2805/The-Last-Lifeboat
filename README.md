The Last Lifeboat
The Last Lifeboat is a data-driven project that analyzes the survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic. By applying machine learning techniques, this project aims to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, class, sex, and embarkation location. The goal is to provide insights into the factors influencing survival during the Titanic disaster.

Overview
In April 1912, the RMS Titanic sank after striking an iceberg, leading to the deaths of over 1,500 people. This project uses historical data from the Titanic disaster to analyze the survival chances of passengers. By building predictive models using machine learning, we aim to uncover the key factors that determined whether a passenger survived.

The Last Lifeboat uses the Titanic dataset available on Kaggle to apply various machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests to predict survival outcomes.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze trends and patterns in the data to uncover relationships between different factors and survival rates.
Predictive Modeling: Use machine learning algorithms to predict survival based on features like sex, age, class, and embarkation location.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of different machine learning models and select the best-performing one.
Visualization: Visualize survival rates and key insights using graphs and charts.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical computations
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation
Matplotlib: For data visualization
Seaborn: For advanced statistical plots and visualizations
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and presentation
Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/.

You will also need the following libraries, which can be installed using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
Steps to Install:
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-last-lifeboat.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd the-last-lifeboat
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook file Titanic_Survival_Analysis.ipynb to begin exploring and running the analysis.

Usage
Load the Dataset: The dataset (available in CSV format) is loaded into the project and can be found in the data/ folder.

Data Preprocessing: Perform necessary data cleaning steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

Train the Model: Use algorithms like logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests to build and train models on the dataset.

Evaluate the Model: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Make Predictions: Use the trained model to predict the survival of new passengers.

Visualize Insights: Use Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that reveal patterns in the data.

Data
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset available from Kaggle. The dataset includes the following features:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = First, 2 = Second, 3 = Third)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Fare paid by the passenger
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Data Processing:
Missing Values: Handle missing values in columns like Age and Embarked.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or modify existing ones based on insights from data exploration.
Normalization/Scaling: Normalize or scale features such as Fare for model training.
